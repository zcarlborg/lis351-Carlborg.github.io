	<p>Football is one of those sports for me that has brought me so many memories as a kid. I've had the pleasure of playing this sport with a lot of my friends growing up and allowed to find the group of friends I currently hang out with now. Football means more than strategy to me, which is why it is my favorite sportto play!</p>
