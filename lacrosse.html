			<p>Lacrosse is one of my favorite sports becasue the sport has been very unpopular in the past, but now is proving that it is a very interesting sport to watch. With the fast paced gameplay, and the competition in the <a href= "https://premierlacrosseleague.com/">PLL</a> (Premier Lacrosse League) and in division 1 college lacrosse, it has become a very fast paced, continuous game that gains my attention. </p>
